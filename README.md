- background
  - This repo contains some projects and snippets showing various programming techniques that I have worked with.
    What to put in a portifolio repo like this is not so easy to know. Most of the time I work for money and
    those projects are not public. Some of my private projects I don't want to show, because of business reasons.
    Which coding tools are ok to use? Should things be developed in the most efficient way, reusing code? Or maybe in
    the most complicated way to show skills? Should it be deployed and what will it cost if somebody runs a massive
    performance test on an auto scaling instance set? This repo is some kind of compromise to show I have some
    experience in developing and customizing code. Keep in mind this is developed on free time.
